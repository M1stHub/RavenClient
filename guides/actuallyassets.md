# Actually Assets - A vanilla-esque resource pack made for Skyblock

ActuallyAssets is a Hypixel Skyblock texture pack that has three main goals:
- Blend: Textures that blend in with vanilla textures as much as possible
- Recognizable: Textures that are quite recognizable, you can take only a glance and you know what it is
- Clean: No animations, no lone pixels, no models, no trickery, just simple and clean textures

This pack also features some custom skull textures and mithril textures if you use the NotEnoughUpdates mod!
