# Patcher - How do I use it?

The commands for patcher are:
> /patcher, /patcher sounds, /patcher name, /patcher blacklist, /patcher benchmark, /patcher debugfps, /patcher vanilla/optimized (useless), /fov, /sendcoords, /invscale

From there on you will be greeted with a peculiar GUI (see image below) or with tips on how to use the command.

You can navigate the settings using the Menu on the left

In the top right you can find a small magnifying glass. Hover over it and you can search for features:
